# 18 - Hash Tables

- Hash tables are used to store **key-value** pairs.

- `Hashing` takes a key and returns an index.

- `Buckets` are used to store the key-value pairs.

- `Collisions` occur when two keys are hashed to the same index.
  - They are resolved by storing the key-value pairs in the same bucket using a linked list.
