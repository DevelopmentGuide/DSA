# 14 - Insertion sort

- Insertion sort compareselements to the **left** of the current element, and **inserts** the current element in the correct position.

- It has an **O(n^2)** time complexity, which makes it **inefficient** on **large** lists, and generally performs worse than the similar **selection sort**.
