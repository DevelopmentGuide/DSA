# 11 - Interpolation search

- Interpolation search is an **improvement** over binary search for instances, where the values in a sorted array are **uniformly distributed**.

- It is an **algorithm** for searching for a **key** in an **array** that has been **sorted** by the **values** of the **key**.

- `O(log log n)` in the **best case** and `O(n)` in the **worst case**.
