# 03 - Queues

- A **queue** is a data structure in which items are top and removed from top

- It is based on `FIFO` principle

    - It means that the **first element** that is **added** to the stack and the **first element** to be **removed** from the stack

- **Queue operations**

    - `offer` will add an element to the **top** of the queue

    - `poll` will remove the **top element** from the queue

- **Used for** 
  - Basic operations like `enqueue` and `dequeue`
  - Keyboard buffer - `Ctrl + Z` in text editors

- **Used in** 
    - **[Linked list](../05-linked-list/README.md)**
    - **[PriorityQueues](../04-priority/README.md)**
    - **[breadth-first search](../23-breadth-search/README.md)** algorithm
