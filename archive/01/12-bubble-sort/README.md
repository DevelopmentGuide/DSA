# 12 - Bubble sort

- Bubble sort is a **simple** sorting algorithm that **repeatedly steps** through the list

- It **compares** adjacent elements and **swaps** them if they are in the **wrong order**.

- The pass through the list is repeated until the list is **sorted**.

- `O(n^2)` in the **best case**.
