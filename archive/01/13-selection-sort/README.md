# 13 - Selection sort

- Selection sort is an **in-place** comparison sorting algorithm.

- It has an **O(n^2)** time complexity, which makes it **inefficient** on **large** lists, and generally performs worse than the similar **insertion sort**.

- The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: the **sublist of items already sorted**, which is built up from **left to right** at the **front** (left) of the list, and the **sublist of items remaining to be sorted** that occupy the rest of the list.

- `O(n^2)` in the **best case**
