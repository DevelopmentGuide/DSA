# 25 - Binary search tree

- **Binary search tree** is a **node-based binary tree data structure** which has the following properties:
  - The **left subtree** of a node contains only nodes with **keys lesser** than the node's key.
  - The **right subtree** of a node contains only nodes with **keys greater** than the node's key.
  - The **left and right subtree** each must also be a binary search tree.
  - There must be **no duplicate nodes**.
